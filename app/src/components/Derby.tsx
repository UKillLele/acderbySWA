                                        The easiest way to learn is to come see a bout in person. Our announcers will give you a quick run down before the first bout starts, but here a few quick tips.

                                        The game of roller derby is relatively simple. Each team has a designated scorer (aka the "jammer") who earns a point every time she laps an opposing player. It's sort of a combination of speed skating and Red Rover, except we use hip checks instead of holding hands (the idea is you don't let the other jammer pass you).

                            <p>It's a lot to take in. Don't be shy. You can ask your neighbor or any of the skaters carrying around "ASK ME"" signs. We love to talk derby. Just focus on the hits, watch the jammers (they usually are on the receiving end of most hits), and build a beer-a-mid or two.</p>
